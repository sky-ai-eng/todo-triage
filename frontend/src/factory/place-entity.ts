// Snapshot-authoritative entity placement.
//
// Single projection function used by both station tray counts AND
// chip positions on the floor: given an entity from the snapshot,
// the set of station-mapped event_types, a per-pair animation
// duration source, and the current wall clock, returns whether the
// entity is parked at a station or in transit between two stations
// (with progress in [0,1]).
//
// Tray counts and chip placement read this same function so the two
// can never drift. Reload-stable rendering falls out for free —
// `recent_events[]` (with both source-time `at` and insert-time
// `detected_at`) on the snapshot encodes exactly enough state to
// resume mid-animation after a refresh, with no client-side cache.
//
// ─── Chain handling ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// When a single poll cycle detects multiple events for the same
// entity (`new_commits` then `ci_check_passed` is the canonical
// pair), the chip should animate through the FULL chain rather than
// teleporting to the final hop. We detect the chain by clustering
// the tail of `recent_events` by `detected_at` gap — events from one
// poll insert within milliseconds; pollers run every 30s+, so any
// small threshold (we use 2s) cleanly separates bursts.
//
// Within the chain, hops play sequentially anchored at the chain's
// first detection time:
//
//   anchor    = chain[0].detected_at
//   hop K     = (chain[K-1] → chain[K])  for K in [1..chain.len-1]
//   hop 0     = (source → chain[0])      where source is the
//               station-mapped event immediately *before* the chain
//               in `recent_events` (the entity's prior position)
//   elapsed   = now - anchor
//   bucket K  = sum of durations(hop[0..K-1]) ≤ elapsed < bucket K+1
//
// Past the total chain duration → parked at chain[last]. Pre-anchor
// (clock skew, future timestamps) → parked at the source. Single-
// event chains reduce to today's behavior automatically.
